# FilteReddit, v1.0

====

Description:
* A Google Chrome extension for Reddit that hides subreddit posts by keyword; it's a lot like bjornstar's Tumblr Savior exension, but much, much simpler. Though it's very basic right now, I'm interested in possibly adding more features in the future.

How to install:
* Download and unzip the repository.
* Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
* Check the "Developer Mode" box at the top.
* Click "load unpacked extension"
* You will be prompted to select a folder. Navigate to the folder where the repository is stored, and select it.
* FilteReddit should appear the extension list. If so, you're good!

Important notes:
* This extension ONLY works in Google Chrome, as it makes some use of Chome's APIs.
* This extension has NOT been tested for compatibility with Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES), so it is unknown whether or not it is compatible. However, it will definitely not work with RES' "Never Ending Reddit" feature enabled (see below).
* Due to the way this extension works, if you're using any extensions or extension features that enable "endless scrolling" on Reddit, the extension will NOT work correctly.
