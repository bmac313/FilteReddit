# FilteReddit, v1.0

====

Description:
* A Google Chrome extension for Reddit that hides subreddit posts by keyword; it's a lot like bjornstar's Tumblr Savior exension, but much, much simpler. Though it's very basic right now, I'm interested in possibly adding more features in the future.

How to install:
* Download and unzip the repository.
* Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
* Check the "Developer Mode" box at the top.
* Click "load unpacked extension"
* You will be prompted to select a folder. Navigate to the folder where the repository is stored, and select it.
* FilteReddit should appear the extension list. If so, you're good!

Notes:
* This extension ONLY works in Google Chrome, as it makes some use of Chome's APIs.
